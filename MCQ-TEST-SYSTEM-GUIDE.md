# 📝 MCQ Test System - Complete Guide

## 🎯 System Overview

### What It Does:
1. **Teacher** posts MCQ tests (15-20 questions) for their class with a deadline
2. **Students** see tests in "Test Knowledge" page on dashboard
3. **Student Progress** shows completed, pending, and overdue tests
4. **Teacher** clicks a student to see their test results and progress

---

## 🗄️ Database Setup

### Run this SQL script in Neon Console:

**File**: `sus - Copy/backend/database-addon-simple.sql`

This creates:
- ✅ `mcq_tests` table - Teacher-posted tests
- ✅ `test_submissions` table - Student submissions with auto-scoring
- ✅ Views for progress tracking
- ✅ Trigger for automatic score calculation
- ✅ Helper function for detailed progress

## 🎨 Frontend Integration

### Update TestKnowledge.jsx

```javascript
// Fetch student's tests
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/student/tests', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  })
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => {
    const pending = data.filter(t => t.completion_status === 'pending');
    const completed = data.filter(t => t.completion_status === 'completed');
    setPendingTests(pending);
    setCompletedTests(completed);
  });
}, []);
```

### Update ProgressTracker.jsx

```javascript
// Fetch student's progress
useEffect(() => {
  fetch('http://localhost:5000/api/student/progress', {

  })
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => {
    setProgress(data);
  });
}, []);
```

### Update TeacherDashboard.jsx

// When teacher clicks a student
const viewStudentProgress = (studentId) => {
  fetch(`http://localhost:5000/api/teacher/student/${studentId}/progress`, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  })
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(data => {
    setSelectedStudent(data.student);
